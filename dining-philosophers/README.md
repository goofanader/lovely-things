# Dining Philosophers Problem
A visual representation of the dining philosophers problem.

## Problem
Five philosophers sit around a table. Between each pair of philosophers is a fork, and in the center of the table is a bowl of spaghetti.

Each philosopher does the following:
* **Eats**: Eats spaghetti for a random amount of time using two forks.
* **Thinks**: Thinks about life for a random amount of time without forks.
